# Reverse Turing Test

This project implements an experimental game-based approach to studying human-AI interaction by inverting the traditional Turing Test paradigm. Instead of testing AI's ability to appear human, this study examines how humans modify their behavior when attempting to blend in with AI agents.

## Research Questions

This implementation addresses several key research questions:

1. How do humans modify their communication patterns when deliberately attempting to "pass" as AI?
2. What behavioral markers do AI systems use to distinguish human from AI-generated responses?
3. What strategies do humans employ to emulate AI-like communication?

## Implementation

The project is implemented as an interactive game where:
- One human participant assumes the role of a historical figure
- Multiple AI agents also roleplay as historical figures
- AI systems analyze communication patterns to identify the human participant
- Real-time pattern analysis tracks linguistic and behavioral markers


## Methodology

The study employs a game-based methodology where:
1. Participants engage in role-played conversations
2. AI systems generate contextually appropriate responses
3. Pattern analysis algorithms track communication markers
4. The system attempts to identify the human participant


## Research Applications (May)

This implementation may contribute to:
- Understanding human behavioral adaptation in AI interactions
- Identifying distinguishing features between human and AI communication
- Studying role-play dynamics in human-AI interaction


## Current Limitations

- Limited to text-based interactions
- Single-player implementation
- Fixed set of historical figures
- Basic pattern analysis metrics

## Future Development

Planned enhancements include:
- Expanded pattern analysis capabilities
- Additional historical figures
- Multi-player support
- More sophisticated detection algorithms
